A BI model ready to be applied in companies, with some changes from one company to another.

This is a performance evaluation project to identify employees and managers within companies and their performance and direct them to skills and the success rate of completing projects and the success of projects in relation to the time and budget. The guide and the fully automated project is to provide follow-up to all employees and managers.<br><br>
Part of the project depends on the personal evaluation system through Evaluator, which enables a group of managers to ensure the success of employees and other managers, and another part depends on the self-evaluation system through a group of KPIs to avoid some inconsistent evaluations of personal evaluation.<br><br>
The project provides a solution to the problem of inefficient Employees distribution in projects by analyzing their performance in previous projects and including completing and delivering them on the identified time and budget, thus allocating resources effectively, over budgeting in projects, identifying skill gaps among employees, and identifying distinguished contributors among employees to retain management. Talents, and hence their development programs are low.<br><br>
